Here is the rest of the inline help from the `rudi` command - as you can see, 
rudi subcommands apply to various activities of interest:

```bash
$ rudi

<continued>

available commands:

  job submission:
    inspect     print the parsed values of all job options to STDOUT in YAML format
    mkdir       create the output directory(s) needed by a job configuration file
    submit      queue all required data analysis jobs on the HPC server
    extend      queue only new or deleted/unsatisfied jobs

  status and result reporting:
    status      show the updated status of all previously queued jobs
    report      show the log file of a previously queued job
    script      show the parsed target script for a previously queued job
    ssh         open a shell, or execute a command, on the host running a job
    top         run the 'top' system monitor on the host running a job
    ls          list the contents of the output directory of a specific job

  error handling:
    delete      kill job(s) that have not yet finished running

  pipeline management:
    rollback    revert the job history to a previously archived status file
    purge       clear all status, script and log files associated with the job set

  server management:
    initialize  refresh the 'rudi' script to establish its program targets
    install     re-run the installation process to update suites, etc.
    alias       create an alias, i.e., named shortcut, to this RuDI program target
    add         add one tool suite repository to config/suites.yml and re-install
    list        list all pipelines and apps available in this RuDI installation
    unlock      remove all framework and suite repository locks, to reset after error
    build       build one container with all of a suite's pipelines and apps
    serve       launch the web server to use interactive Dioxus apps
```

### Installation (server) management

Once it is installed the first time, the RuDI CLI has functions - 
like **install**, **add**, **list**, and **build** - 
to help update and maintain the installation, see available pipelines,
build Singularity containers (for developers), and more.

### Pipeline execution and monitoring

You can use the RuDI CLI to execute installed pipelines 
synchronously in the command shell, e.g.:

```bash
#execute 'myPipeline do' on myData.yml, overriding option '--my-option'
rudi myPipeline do myData.yml --my-option 22
```

However, more likely you will want to submit work
to your cluster server's job scheduler, e.g.:

```bash
# similar to above, but defers execution to a cluster node
rudi submit myData.yml --my-option 22
```

Thus, a typical subcommand sequence to execute and monitor work might be:

- **inspect** = show the parsed options for a job file
- **mkdir** = create the output directory
- **submit --dry-run** = check the submission config
- **submit** = queue the work request
- **status** = monitor the jobs' progress
- **top** = watch the processes doing your work on the server node
- **report** = view each task's output log
- **ls** = see the files the job generated

Other subcommands - like **delete**, **rollback**, and **purge** - 
are for error handling and recovery.

### Help on subcommands

Subcommands offer their own inline help when called with no options. 
As one example:

```bash
$ rudi submit

rudi submit: queue all required data analysis jobs on the HPC server

available options:
  -d,--dry-run        check syntax and report actions to be taken; nothing will be queued or deleted
  -x,--delete         kill matching pending/running jobs when repeat job submissions are encountered
  -e,--execute        run target jobs immediately in the shell instead of scheduling them
  -f,--force          suppress warnings that duplicate jobs will be queued, files deleted, etc.
```
